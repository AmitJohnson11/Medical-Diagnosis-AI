# Medical-Diagnosis-AI

Medical Diagnosis A.I. is a prediction A.I. which can help in predicting life threatening diseases in early stages or in later stages if kept undiagnosed. The insterface asks a user a series of questions which could be a routine for the user but could leadd to a major disease.
The questions are of casual manner about daily routine and food intake, and with the help of large dataset provided by indian government and major database like Kaggle.org, through these datasets the program cross checks the habits and routines of the user and compares with the dataset and predicts the activeness of the diesease.


How It Works :

Data Collection & Input – AI systems gather patient information from electronic health records (EHRs), wearable devices, and direct symptom inputs from patients or healthcare providers.

Pattern Recognition & Analysis – Using trained models, AI compares patient data with extensive medical databases and known disease patterns to suggest possible diagnoses.


Benefits of Medical Diagnosis AI :

1.Increased Accuracy – AI can detect patterns that may be overlooked by human doctors, improving diagnostic precision.

2.Faster Diagnosis – Reduces the time required for identifying diseases, enabling quicker treatment.

3. Early Detection – Helps in spotting diseases like cancer, cardiovascular conditions, and neurological disorders in their early stages.

4. Improved Access to Healthcare – AI-powered chatbots and remote diagnostic tools assist patients in underserved or rural areas.

5. Reduced Workload for Physicians – Automates routine diagnostic tasks, allowing doctors to focus on complex cases.



How to Run the Program :

1. Download the zip file of the code.

2. Extract the file in any location.

3. Open the directory in any IDE (preferably VS code)

4. Create a Python environment (Ver==3.12.5 ,at the time of creating this repository)

5. Run the command in terminal : pip install requirements.txt

6. AFter this the program is ready to run using the command in terminal : streamlit run app.py
